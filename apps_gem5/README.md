### RiVEC benchmarks

RiVEC benchmarks have been ported to the AraXL baremetal execution environment added as a gitsubmodule to this repository,

To compile the rivec benchmark,
In the apps folder,
```bash
make rivec_binaries nr_clusters=4
```

To run the rivec benchmark, from the hardware folder run the rivec binary as usual
```bash
make sim app=rivec-binary nr_clusters=4
```

### Hello World
Run the following command to build an application. E.g., `hello_world`:

```bash
cd apps
make bin/hello_world
```

### Convolutions

Convolutions allow to specify the output matrix size and the size of the filter, with the variables `OUT_MTX_SIZE` up to 112 and `F_SIZE` within {3, 5, 7}. Currently, not all the configurations are supported for all the convolutions. For more information, check the `main.c` file for the convolution of interest.
Example:

```bash
cd apps
make bin/fconv2d OUT_MTX_SIZE=112 F_SIZE=7
```

### Standard RISC-V tests

To compile the standardized riscv tests from https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests
```bash
cd apps
make riscv_tests_compile
```

### RISC-V vector tests
To compile and run handwritten test cases for RISC-V vector ISA
```bash
cd apps
make riscv_tests
```
